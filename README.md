# Machine Learning Algorithm Comparison

This project compares the performance of six machine learning algorithms on a test case classification dataset:
1. Random Forest
2. Naive Bayes
3. Decision Tree
4. Logistic Regression
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Files
- `train_test_algorithms.py`: Python script for training and testing the models.
- `classification_results.csv`: Results of the model comparisons.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the script: `python train_test_algorithms.py`

## Results
The results include accuracy scores for all six algorithms, with KNN added as the additional method for comparison.
